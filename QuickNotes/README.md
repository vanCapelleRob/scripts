## QuickNotes
If you want to make notes of what you are doing on your system easy, this is
the program for you!

### How to install
run
> sudo wget -O qn_installer https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanCapelleRob/scripts/master/QuickNotes/qn_installer.sh

> sudo sh qn_installer

I don't know why but on manjaro use

> sudo sh qn_installer your_login_name


or

> sudo curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanCapelleRob/scripts/master/QuickNotes/qn_installer.sh

> sudo sh qn_installer.sh

I don't know why but on manjaro use

> sudo sh qn_installer.sh your_login_name

## What happens
A file /usr/local/bin/qn will be made. This file makes it all possible

A folder ~/.QuickNotes will be created. This is where all your notes will be stored.

The qn_installer(.sh) will be deleted after installation.

## How it works
Simply type

> qn help

in a terminal and it will tell you how to work with it.

Basically, just typing

> qn myNote

will allow you to quicly write down what's on your mind, or what you need to remmember for later in a project.
