## log
If you want to make logs of what you are doing on your system easy, this is
the program for you!

### How to install
run
> sudo wget -O log_installer https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanCapelleRob/scripts/master/log/log_installer.sh

> sudo sh log_installer

or

> sudo curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanCapelleRob/scripts/master/log/log_installer.sh

> sudo sh log_installer.sh

## What happens
A file /usr/local/bin/log will be made. This file makes it all possible

A folder ~/.logs will be created. This is where all your logs will be stored.

The log_installer(.sh) will be deleted after installation.

## How it works
Simply type

> log help

in a terminal and it will tell you how to work with it.

Basically, just typing

> log myLog

will allow you to quicly write down what's on your mind, or what you need to remmember for later in a project.

Never add the .log extention when using the command. It will create a new log file.
